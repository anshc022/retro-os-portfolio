# 🖥️ Shruti's Retro OS Portfolio

A pixel-perfect, retro-inspired web portfolio built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion — bringing the charm of vintage operating systems to life in the browser.

## 🕹️ Overview

This portfolio mimics the experience of using an old-school OS: draggable desktop icons, bootloader screens, pixel fonts, glitch transitions, and windowed apps — all powered by modern web technologies.

You'll find sections like:

- 🧑‍💻 About.exe — a window into who I am
- 💼 Projects.exe — selected works & experiments
