# Music Files

This folder contains music files for the retro music player.

To add real music:
1. Add .mp3 files to this folder
2. Update the tracks array in MusicPlayer.jsx with the correct file paths

Recommended retro/synthwave music themes:
- Synthwave
- Chiptune
- 8-bit music
- Retrowave
- Cyberpunk ambient

Note: The music player currently uses placeholder tracks. 
Replace the src paths in MusicPlayer.jsx with actual music file paths.
